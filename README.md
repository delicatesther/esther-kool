## Installation

Prerequisites to running the site service locally:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Latest LTS version or higher)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is used as build tool.

When using Node.js version >= 16.10, Yarn is included and available by running:

```bash
corepack enable
```

When these core-dependencies are installed, you can install the rest of the dependencies for this project by going to your project root and running:

```bash
yarn
```

### process.ENV

Our project depends on environment variables, saved in `.env` files in the root of the project. `.env.development` contains development variables, `.env.production` contains the production ones. NextJS picks up the correct file automatically, based on the publicRuntimeConfig (server + client) and serverRuntimeConfig (server side only) keys in the NextJS config file in the root of the project.

```bash
# NextJS picks variables in .env.development:

yarn dev

# NextJS picks up variables from .env.production:

yarn start
```

If you are in need of secret variables, store them in a new file called `.env.local` in the root.

⚠️ **WARNING**: `.env.local` should _**never**_ be committed into the repository, because it can contain sensitive data (tokens, account details, etc).

### Clean dependency install

If you run into some dependency issues, sometimes a clean install will help. To do so, simply delete the `node_modules` folder and the either `package-lock.json` (for npm) or `yarn.lock` (for yarn) and run the installation script again.

Committing adjusted lock files is advised to keep the project as similar as possible between developers, which is why we advise using `yarn` as well, so everything stays in sync.

## Developing locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Storybook

To run a local Storybook instance, run:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Storybook will open up it's own local server on [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

---

## Building

To build a production version of the site service, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

To build an export of Storybook, run:

```bash
yarn build-storybook
```
